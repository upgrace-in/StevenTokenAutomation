If the records that we pull every 6 hours, I would also like to have a set which filters by 25 trades so I can display it in the website in milestone 4 (website stage).

E.g

We may have a collection of 200 transactions during the 6 hour period

We need the following

1) Query the collection during the 6 hour period

2) from the collection in query 1 filter the top wallets by token and show top 25 wallets

Wallet. - token

User 1 - 1,000,000
User 2 - 999,123
User 3 - 990,000
User 4 - 850,000

User 25 - 650,000
